            <p>Cloud computing, often referred to as simply “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources — everything from applications to data centers — over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Elastic resources: Scale up or down quickly and easily to meet changing demand.</li>
  <li>Metered services: Pay only for what you use.

                    Cloud computing dates back to the 1950s, and over the years, it has evolved through many phases that were first pioneered by IBM, including grid, utility and on-demand computing.

                   While the term “cloud” may seem abstract, the benefits of cloud computing to customers are very real and tangible. IBM — as well as its clients around the world — is adopting cloud computing in recognition of its potential to usher in a new era of responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency in IT service delivery.
<br>
As the cloud has gained popularity and acceptance in the computing world, more and more businesses are making the switch. In fact, 75 percent of existing non-cloud apps will move to the cloud within the next three years.<br>

Cloud computing benefits continuously evolve with the addition of new services, the conducting of uncompromising research and the creation of innovations that relentlessly push the boundaries of the underlying technology and architecture.
<br>
                    Seven benefits of cloud from an enterprise architecture standpoint:</p>
<br><ul>
                <li>Cost efficiency</li>
                <li>Choice</li>
                <li>Scale: flexibility and elasticity</li>
                <li>Speed</li>
                <li>Integration</li>
                <li>Audit and compliance</li>
                <li>Business continuity planning</li></ul>
                <p>
While cloud computing brings great opportunity, it can also introduce challenges for business leaders and IT departments. By far, the most common disadvantages that continue to taint perceptions about cloud computing are security problems and inconsistent performance.<br>

The good news is that these challenges can be overcome with a cloud architecture built specifically for your workloads and through the efforts of a strong, reliable cloud service provider.

                <h3> Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>
Platform as a service provides a cloud-based environment with everything required to support the complete lifecycle of building and delivering web-based (cloud) applications — all without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware, software, provisioning and hosting.
<br>
Benefits of PaaS:
<br><ul>
                <li>Develop application and get to market faster</li>
                <li>Deploy new web applications to the cloud in minutes</li>
                <li>Reduce complexity with middleware as a service</li></ul>

                <h2> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h2>
              Infrastructure as a service provides companies with computing resources — including servers, networking, storage and data-center space — on a pay-per-use basis.
<br>
Benefits of IaaS:
<br><ul><li>
                No need to invest in your own hardware</li>
                <li>Infrastructure scales on demand to support dynamic workloads</li>
                <li>Flexible, innovative services available on demand</li></ul>

                <h2>Software as a service (SaaS)</h2>
Cloud-based applications — or software as a service — run on distant computers “in the cloud” that are owned and operated by others and that connect to users’ computers via the internet and (usually) a web browser.<br>

Benefits of SaaS:<br>
<ul>
    <li>You can sign up and rapidly start using innovative business apps</li>
    <li>Apps and data are accessible from any connected computer</li>
<li>No data is lost if your computer breaks, because the data is in the cloud</li>
    <li>The service is able to dynamically scale to usage needs</li></ul><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2013/09/18/top-five-advantages-of-software-as-a-service-saas/">
